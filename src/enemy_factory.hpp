/**
 * @brief A class which handles the logic about what enemies come and how much
 * of during each round
 *
 * The logic as in "Which enemies are present in the round?" is as follows:
 *    In addition to the round number m_round, we have a Fibonacci-like
 * sequence, where a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = 1 and after that a_n = a_(n-2) + a_(n-3).
 * Then, from the binary representation of a_(m_round) we look at which bits are
 * set, starting from the least significant bits, and the i:th bit being set
 * means that the i:th enemy type is present. For example on 6th round a_6 = 3,
 * which is ...0011 in binary, so enemies 0 (Homework) and 1 (Essay) are
 * present. The numbers a_n in the sequence may also overflow at some point, but
 * that is ok. The logic as in "How many enemies come during the round?" is
 * based on the array m_batchSizes. After each round an enemy type is present,
 * the batch size will also be incremented according to the deltas.
 *
 * This class allocates the enemies dynamically, and then the game logic class
 * is responsible for freeing the memory when enemies either reach the end or
 * die
 *
